# [Key Stakeholders in Clinical Research – Roles and Skills for the Application of GCP Principles](https://globalhealthtrainingcentre.tghn.org/elearning/education/ich-gcp-e6-r3/M3/12987/)

This module explains the main roles and responsibilities of critical stakeholders in clinical research and the competencies they need to apply GCP ICH E6(R3) and WHO best practices. Focus is given to the **IRB/IEC** and the **Investigator** as examples of ethical oversight and operational responsibility in clinical trials.

## Introduction

Clinical research is collaborative and requires coordination among multiple stakeholders. Each has defined roles in ensuring ethics, quality, and participant protection.

---

## Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)

**Definition:** Independent committees composed of medical and non-medical members tasked with protecting participants’ rights, safety, and well-being.

**Roles:**

* Review and approve protocols, informed consent materials, and recruitment methods.
* Ensure ethical and scientific validity of trials, with special focus on vulnerable groups.
* Monitor ongoing studies through periodic reviews and safety assessments.
* Maintain records of decisions, member qualifications, and communications.
* Operate under local laws but aligned with international standards (Helsinki, CIOMS, WHO).

**Example:** In a Phase III antibiotic trial, the IRB/IEC halted recruitment after detecting severe hepatotoxicity and arrhythmias, demanded protocol modifications, updated consent forms, and allowed continuation only with stricter monitoring.

---

## Investigator

**Definition:** The individual (often Principal Investigator) responsible for the conduct of a clinical trial, including participant safety, data integrity, and compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements.

**General Responsibilities:**

* **Qualifications:** Must demonstrate appropriate training and experience.
* **Resources:** Ensure adequate facilities, staff, and participant recruitment capacity.
* **Oversight:** Delegate tasks responsibly but maintain accountability.
* **Ethics:** Obtain informed consent and communicate with IRB/IEC.
* **Protocol Compliance:** Prevent, report, and correct deviations.
* **Safety:** Provide medical care, report adverse events promptly, and protect participant well-being.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensure accurate, traceable, and secure data management.
* **Product Management:** Store, dispense, and document investigational products appropriately.
* **Communication:** Report results and submit documentation to sponsors and regulators.

**Example:** In a urinary tract infection trial, when a patient developed acute kidney failure, the Investigator immediately stopped treatment, ensured medical care, and reported the serious adverse event to the Sponsor and IRB/IEC. The case led to possible protocol changes, updated consent, or temporary suspension.

---

## Sponsor

* An individual, institution, or company that initiates, finances, and manages a clinical trial.
* Responsibilities include:

  * Designing scientifically valid and feasible studies.
  * Ensuring risk-based quality management and pharmacovigilance.
  * Selecting qualified investigators and sites, ensuring adequate resources.
  * Overseeing delegated tasks while maintaining accountability.
  * Managing investigational products, data integrity, safety reporting, and regulatory compliance.
* **Example:** In a hypertension drug trial, a sponsor identified data inconsistencies at one site, retrained staff, increased monitoring, reported findings to authorities, and assessed potential impacts on validity.

---

## Data Governance

* Ensures **data integrity, traceability, and security** across the data lifecycle.
* Responsibilities include:

  * Accurate data collection, verification, and interpretation.
  * Safeguarding confidentiality, metadata, and audit trails.
  * Protecting blinding, ensuring proper use of computerized systems, and validating processes.
  * Implementing secure data transfers, archiving, and controlled disposal.
* Strong governance is essential for reliable analyses, regulatory compliance, and protection of participants.

---

## Other Stakeholders

* **Participants and communities** are recognized as active contributors, enriching research design and ensuring studies address real-world needs.
* Additional actors include sub-investigators, advisory boards, data safety monitoring boards, and service providers, all collaborating to ensure ethical and scientific quality.

---

## Essential Skills for Compliance with GCP

* **IRB/IEC:** Ethical and regulatory expertise, critical protocol review, clear communication.
* **Investigator:** Methodology knowledge, leadership, ethical decision-making, communication with participants and team.
* **Sponsor:** Project management, funding, regulatory knowledge, quality oversight.
* **Data Governance:** Data validation, risk management, technical expertise in secure systems.
* Across all roles: ethical commitment, collaboration, and continuous education are key.

---

## Summary and Key Points to Remember

* **IRB/IEC, Investigators, Sponsors, and Data Governance** are central stakeholders ensuring compliance with GCP.
* Each has distinct but complementary roles, requiring specialized skills.
* Active involvement of **participants and communities** strengthens trust, relevance, and shared responsibility.
* Protecting participants’ rights and ensuring reliable, transparent results is the unifying priority of all stakeholders.

**Overall Summary**
Module 3 emphasizes that the success and integrity of clinical research rely on the interplay of clearly defined and complementary stakeholder roles. Ethical oversight, operational leadership, organizational responsibility, and data integrity management form the pillars of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), ensuring that studies are ethically sound, scientifically robust, and socially relevant.

* **IRBs/IECs** function as guardians of ethics and participant welfare. They provide independent review, ongoing monitoring, and ensure compliance with international and local standards.
* **Investigators** lead the execution of clinical trials, carrying direct responsibility for participant safety, protocol adherence, and data accuracy. Their leadership bridges science with patient care.
* **Sponsors** hold organizational responsibility for designing, funding, and supervising studies. They ensure risk-proportionate quality management, reliable results, and compliance with regulatory requirements while maintaining accountability for delegated tasks.
* **Data Governance** safeguards the integrity, confidentiality, and traceability of data across the entire research lifecycle, enabling accurate reporting and reliable decision-making.

Beyond these core roles, the module highlights the **importance of participant and community involvement**, which enriches study design, aligns research with real-world needs, and fosters public trust.

Ultimately, ethical and scientific integrity in clinical research is achieved when these stakeholders collaborate effectively, guided by the principles of ICH GCP E6(R3) and WHO best practices. This collaboration ensures that participant rights are protected, data remain reliable, and research contributes meaningfully to advancing healthcare.
