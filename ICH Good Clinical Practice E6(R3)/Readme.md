## [Introduction](https://globalhealthtrainingcentre.tghn.org/ich-gcp-r3/preface/)

The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) established Good Clinical Practices (GCP) in 1996 (E6(R1)) to protect participantsâ€™ rights, safety, and well-being while ensuring reliable study data. The 2016 revision (E6(R2)) addressed electronic data systems, risk-based quality management, and globalization, introducing centralized monitoring and stronger transparency and security policies. The 2025 update (E6(R3)) adapts to advanced technologies, decentralized and patient-centered trials, and emphasizes ethics, integrity, patient involvement, and flexible risk-based quality approaches.
